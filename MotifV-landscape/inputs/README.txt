These are the input for the string calculations on the conformational landscape of Motif V in each ligation state: ATP, ADPÂ·P and ADP+P.
ZikaNS3h-reactants.prmtop is the parameter file for the structures with ATP, while ZikaNS3h-products.prmtop is the parameter file for the structures with ADP and dihydrogen phosphate.
The rest of input files are shared among the three calculations.
