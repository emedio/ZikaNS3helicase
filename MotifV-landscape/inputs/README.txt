These are the input for the string calculations on the conformational landscape of Motif V in each ligation state: ATP, ADP·P and ADP+P.

ZikaNS3h-reactants.prmtop is the parameter file for the structures with ATP, while ZikaNS3h-products.prmtop is the parameter file for the structures with ADP and dihydrogen phosphate.

The rest of input files are shared among the three calculations, with exception of group_file. In such file the only difference is the name of the input structure and parameter file for each ligation state.
