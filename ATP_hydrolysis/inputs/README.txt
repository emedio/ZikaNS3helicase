These are the input files for the string calculation of ATP hydrolysis at the B3LYPD3/6-31G*/MM level. 

The guess is the converged reaction path of a preliminar string calculation at the DFTB3 level. In the same way, the initial structures are the final structures of the preliminar calculation.

The restraint file applies restraints to the O-H and Mg-O bonds of the water molecules in the Mg coordination sphere.
